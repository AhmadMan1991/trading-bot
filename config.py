"""Central configuration — gold-only (XAUUSD) ICT/SMC engine.

Rebuilt from a 9-asset, 5-competing-engine system (scalp_engine + swing_engine
+ council + forecast_engine + btc_deep_pipeline, each with their own scoring
method) down to ONE deterministic engine (gold_engine.py) focused entirely on
XAUUSD, because running five different methods in parallel on nine assets was
producing exactly the kind of cross-engine disagreement (and debate-gated
NO_TRADE deadlock) that made signals rare and inconsistent."""

# swing are different trades and now get different geometry.
